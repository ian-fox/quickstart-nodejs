# Workflow list definition
# This list describes the order that the Jobs execute. The "main" Job is always
# executed first, followed in order of the Jobs listed in this Workflow block.
workflow:
  # We define the workflow where the "publish" Job is started after the "main" Job.
  - wait
  - finish


# Shared definition block
# This is where you would define any attributes that all your jobs will
# inherit.
shared:
  # We specify a common NodeJS Docker image for our Jobs. It takes the form of
  # "repo_name:tag_label", where the "tag_label" is optional.
  # Docker image - https://hub.docker.com/r/library/node/
  image: node:6

# Jobs definition block
# All pipelines have "main" by default, and is implicitly defined.
jobs:
  # We explicitly define "main" in our configuration so that it does what we want
  # it to do.
  main:
    # Steps is the ordered list of commands to execute.
    # Each step takes the form "step_name: command_to_run". The "step_name" is a
    # convenient label to reference it by. The "command_to_run" is the single
    # command that is executed during the step.
    steps:
      # Our "install" step is first in the list. It installs your NodeJS dependencies
      # NPM reference document - https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install
      - install: npm install
      # The next step is "test". It tests your NodeJS package
      # NPM reference document - https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/test
      - test: npm test
  # We define another Job called "publish". In this stage of the pipeline, we intend
  # on publishing our package to the NPM Registry.
  wait:
    steps:
      # Sleep so I have time to show the build is running
      - sleep 60

  finish:
    steps:
      # Print stuff
      - echo "All done!"
